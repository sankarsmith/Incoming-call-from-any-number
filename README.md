Abstract
The actual issue is consider two mobile phones like Cell A and Cell B.
If a call triggered from cell A to Cell B means Cell B will display cell A number.
Here Cell B (Network) is not verifying or authenticate like these call is originally triggered from cell A.
What cell B actually doing means it simply display that incoming number in Mobile panel.

Solution:
1.API Network needs to validate from number(Like it should not allow other numbers as from number).
2.Telecom Network need to authenticate that call from number.
